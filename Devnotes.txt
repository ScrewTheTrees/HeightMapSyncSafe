Build 7:
CSV, one per sync: 1213 seconds.
5 bytes - 15 bytes

Could probably be more performant.


Build 94:
16 bits to 2 char: 904 seconds
Always 6 bytes;

Data bad as i didnt know about null terminated strings at the time,
so actual time probably slightly longer.



Build 157:
14 bits to 2 char, assemble into 240 chunks: 345 seconds
240 bytes;

Almost there...



BlzSendSyncData:
    * Max length: 255
    * Is null terminated, so dont use
    * There is some max quota when sending data, but sending large strings is
      far more efficient than many strings, so probably some overhead.
    * Running too much data through this is gonna stop all player interactions.
    * Only stops the player interactions for the players who is sending the data.
